Chapter 9 The Arrow of History

-Network of artificial instincts is culture
-Cultures frequently undergo change, whether it be from external pressures or from internal dynamics
	-Man made orders are rife with contradictions, so culture tries to adapt to reconcile these
	-One attempt was the Crusades, where someone could prove their merit as a fighter and their religious devotion simultaneously
	-Modern example: Kicked off by French Revolution - Equality vs individual freedom
-Without cognitive dissonance, people woul be unable to hold contradictory beliefs in their head it would be hard to have culture
-Examine smaller chunks of history, hard to tell if moving towards unity or diversity. Need to look at bigger picture to see unity.
-World used to be very disconnected, see Tasmania
-No "authentic" cultures remaining on Earth, every single one has received a ton of influence from other cultures
	-No horses in America in 1492, very interesting

-"In fact, no social animal is ever guided by the interests of the entire species to which it belongs"
-First universal order to appear was economic (monetary order), second was political (imperial order), third was religious

Chapter 10 The Scent of Money

-Hunter gatherers and early farmers could rely on a system of favours and obligations for trade
-After cities developed and people became more specialized, a new system was needed to facilitate logical trade
-Barter was useful to an extent, but couldnt be the entire complex economic system
	-"In a barter economy, every day the shoemaker and the apple grower will have to learn anew the relative prices of dozens of 		commodities"
	-People didnt always want to trade for the good you were offering
-Some societies tried to establish a central barter system that collected products and redistributed them (Soviet Communism)
-Many instead turned to developing a monetary system
-Physical coins and banknotes are actually a small percentage of all monetary systems even today
	-90% of money today exists only in digital format, which is lighter/faster/easier to track
-Ideal types of money allow conversion of anything into something that allows you to buy anything, and also allows wealth accumulation
-Money is built just on trust and shared fiction, most universal trust system ever devised
-First known money system was Sumerian barley system
	-The sila was about 1 liter of barley, special bowls made to allow for easy measurement
	-Not ideal, since it was hard to store and transoprt, but a good foot in the door system
-Real breakthrough was in the 3rd millenium BCE in Mesopotamia with the silver shekel
	-No inherent value, but easy to store and transport, unmarked silver ingot
-Coins eventually came next, starting in the Lydian empire
	-Two distinct advantages over ingots: Didn't need to be weighed each time, had official markings from the ruler declaring 	that the coinage was legitimate
	-Counterfeiting was considered such a sin because it went against the sovereignty of the land
-"Once trade connects two areas, the forces of supply and demand tend to equalise the prices of transportable goods"
-"Although money builds universal trust between strangers, this trust is invested not in humans, communities or sacred values, but in money itself and in the impersonal systems that back it. We do not trust the stranger, or the next-door neighbour – we trust the coin they hold."

Chapter 11 Imperial Visions

-Numantians were total badasses and fucked with the Roman empire until they were forced to burn themselves to death
-What is an empire? Must have rule over a number of different peoples with different cultural identity and territory, and flexible borders with the capacity to integrate more territories w/o altering basic identiy or structure
-Empires were one of the main reasons for decrease in human diversity
	-Criticisms: Empires do not work effectively in the long run; empires are engines of evil and destruction and human 	exploitation
-Author says empires are very stable, but I'm not sure I agree...
-Most cultures absorbed into empires would eventually blend together, leaving little remnants after the empire dissolved hundreds or thousands of years later
-Empire building was often very violent murdering followed up with oppression of the survivors
	-Author claims 'at least it wasnt all bad, they financed the arts too'
-Akkadian Empire with Sargon the Greta was first we have info about, set a precedent for future empire builders to follow
-Cyrus the Great of the Persian Empire was the first to claim conquering for the good of the conquered
	-Examples of future claims are the Mandate of Heaven
-Empires played a large part in jamming cultures together into one bigger imperial culture
	-Intentionally spread customs/norms/ideas, since it made it easier to rule amalgamated subjects
-"Many Americans nowadays maintain that their government has a moral imperative to bring Third World countries the benefits of democracy and human rights, even if these goods are delivered by cruise missiles and F-16s."
-Imperial cycle: 
	1. Small group establishes big empire
	2. Imperial culture forged
	3. Imperial culture adopted by subjects
	4. Subjects demand equal status in the name of common imperial values
	5. Empire founders lose dominance
	6. Imperial culture continues to grow and flourish

-Who are the bad guys and good guys in history? Disagree with author, pretty much everyone has been shitty the entire way and to this day most of us are the "bad guys"
-Global empire on the horizon? Truly human concerns such as global warming, deforestation, human rights, etc. are not national concerns
-"Immensely powerful currents of capital, labour and information turn and shape the world, with a growing disregard for the borders and opinions of states."

Chapter 12 The Law of Religion

-Religion can be defined as "a system of human norms and values that is founded on a  belief in a superhuman order"
	-Establishes norms and values that are considered binding
	-To be a unifying religion, it must also be universal and missionary
-Possible origin for gods was needing a solution to problems with animal health and fertility
-Animistic views faded away, need an authority with a wider range of dominion
-Polytheism developed to have gods for different reasons, and sacrifices and prayers were made to appease them
-"Two thousand years of monotheistic brainwashing have caused most Westerners to see polytheism as ignorant and childish idolatry
	-The irony
-"The fundamental insight of polytheism, which distinguishes it from monotheism, is that the supreme power governing the world is devoid of interests and biases, and therefore it is unconcerned with the mundane desires, cares and worries of humans."

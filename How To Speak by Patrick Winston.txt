Opening:

-Start with an empowerment promise: What will the audience know by the end of your lecture/speech/presentation?

-Jokes typically don't land very well at the beginning because people are settling in and not really focused yet

Armamentarium

-Cycling: Returning to important points several times to emphasize them and make sure they're memorable

-Build a fence: Frame your idea and outline it so that it isn't confused with somebody else's idea

-Verbal punctuation: Give some sense of landmarks in the talk where people who aren't really paying attention have the opportunity to mentally rejoin the flow of the talk

-Ask a question: Waiting through seven seconds of silence is fairly standard. Question must be chosen carefully; if it's too hard, no one will be able to answer it, yet if it's too easy no one will want to answer it.


Time and Place

-Time: 11am is a good time, everyone is awake, no one is tired yet, and it's not right after a meal

-Place: 
	-Most important thing is that the room is well-lit. Dim rooms put people to sleep. 
	-The location should also be cased out, so that it is somewhat familiar and doesnt throw you off guard during the real deal
	-The room should be well-populated, but not necessarily packed

Tools of the Trade

-Chalkboard (Whiteboard also)

	-Graphic element to the presentation, allows easily connected ideas through arrows and bubbles and such

	-Speed: the speed at which you write on the board is approximately the speed at which people can absorb ideas

	-Target: gives something to point at with your hands, as many people struggle with hand placement

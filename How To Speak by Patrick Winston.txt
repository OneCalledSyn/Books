Opening:

-Start with an empowerment promise: What will the audience know by the end of your lecture/speech/presentation?

-Jokes typically don't land very well at the beginning because people are settling in and not really focused yet

Armamentarium

-Cycling: Returning to important points several times to emphasize them and make sure they're memorable

-Build a fence: Frame your idea and outline it so that it isn't confused with somebody else's idea

-Verbal punctuation: Give some sense of landmarks in the talk where people who aren't really paying attention have the opportunity to mentally rejoin the flow of the talk

-Ask a question: Waiting through seven seconds of silence is fairly standard. Question must be chosen carefully; if it's too hard, no one will be able to answer it, yet if it's too easy no one will want to answer it.


Time and Place

-Time: 11am is a good time, everyone is awake, no one is tired yet, and it's not right after a meal

-Place: 
	-Most important thing is that the room is well-lit. Dim rooms put people to sleep. 
	-The location should also be cased out, so that it is somewhat familiar and doesnt throw you off guard during the real deal
	-The room should be well-populated, but not necessarily packed

Tools of the Trade

-Chalkboard (Whiteboard also)

	-Graphic element to the presentation, allows easily connected ideas through arrows and bubbles and such

	-Speed: the speed at which you write on the board is approximately the speed at which people can absorb ideas

	-Target: gives something to point at with your hands, as many people struggle with hand placement 

-Props: Very useful and engaging for the audience, maybe some aspect of "empathetic mirroring"

-Slides: 
	-We only have one language processor, so we can only listen or read effectively, not both at the same time
	-When slides have a lot of material on them, the audience focuses on those and doesnt pay attention to the speaker
	-Don't clutter, don't read, keep images simple, be in the image
	-Big font size helpful to force yourself to not write too much
	-Avoid using wooden pointing stick because it turns into a baton show and it distracts listeners
	-Laser pointers should also be eschewed because to use them, you have to turn the back of your head to the audience and it's 	 less engaging for them with no facial features or eye contact. Use an actual arrow on the slide instead
	-Very complicated graphical slide should be a hapax legomenon


Informing: How to Inspire

-Being passionate about what you are doing

How to Teach People How to Think

-Provide them with:
	-The stories they need to know
	-The questions they need to think about those stories
	-Mechanisms for analyzing those stories
	-Ways of putting stories together
	-Ways of evaluating how reliable a story is

Persuasion

-Need to have a vision
-Need to have done something
-Only get about 5 minutes to demonstrate the above
-Problem, approach, steps, contributions

Being Remembered

-Winston's star:
	-Symbol associated with your work
	-Slogan
	-Surprise
	-Salient idea that sticks out
	-Story

How to Stop

-Not with a collaborators slide, that should go at the beginning
-Don't end with "Questions?" slide either, waste of real estate as people ask questions for 20 minutes and only look at that phrase
-'For more details:'/'The end'/'Thank you' all do nothing and waste opportunity
-Final slide should be contributions from the speaker

Final Words

-Joke is okay now; 'finish with a joke and people think they had fun the whole time'
-Don't end with 'Thank you' because it's weak and suggests people stayed out of politeness
-Salute the audience (not the gesture)
